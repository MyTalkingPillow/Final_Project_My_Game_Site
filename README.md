# Final_Project_My_Game_Site
 Description: A website to host games I will code.
 
 Project Recap: My goal for the project was to get a website up an running with some functioning games hosted on it. In that respect I have failed. That being said what I have accomplished is half of it, albeit, incompletely. That is to say I have made the website part. In terms of what I have gained from this project, is some familarity with html and css, but more importantly a better understanding of how to go about doing something similar to this project in the future. What I mean by this is the way I tried to learn html and css was quite inefficient, specifically my heistancy about jumping immidietlly into creating a website as oppose to merely learning syntax and common functions. I seem to learn much better on the go, while applying what I am learning. I think this is the most valuable thing I have gained from this project.
